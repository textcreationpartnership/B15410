            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <hi>First, That the</hi> 214. Bishops <hi>in the</hi> 4.

That hee should have vile <hi>(not Lordly, costly,)</hi> household stuffe, and a poore table and fare, and should seeke the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of his dignity by his faith and merits of life. That hee should not take upon him the Probate or Administration of Wills; nor goe to Law for transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory things though provoked; That hee should not take any care of his temporall estate to himselfe; <hi>Sed lectioni &amp; orationi, &amp; verbi Dei praedicationi TAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TVM MODO VACET;</hi> but should <hi>ONELY</hi> give himselfe to reading, and prayer, and the preaching of Gods word. That hee should ordaine no Ministers without the advise of his Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and the consent and testimony of the Citizens. That hee should heare no mans cause, without the presence of his Clergy; and that otherwise his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence should be meerly voyd, unlesse it were confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the presence and suffrage of his Clergy. That in what place soever hee was sitting, hee should not suffer a Presbyter or Minister to stand; That in the Church and Session of the Presbyters, the Bishop should sit in the upper place: but within any house
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21797:11"/>
               <hi>COLLEGAM SE PRESBYTERORVM AGNOSCAT;</hi> hee should know himselfe to be but the fellow or co-partner of Ministers. Thus this Councell of 214.

               </note> that Bishops and Clergy men ought not to beare any temporall offices, or intermedle with secular affaires, since no man that goeth a warfare to God, ought to intangle himselfe in the affaires of this world: (2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4.) that hee may please him, who hath chosen him to be a soldier. <hi>Whence</hi>

For, and by reason of such things and Bishops, soules are neglected, the sheepe perish, diseases increase, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies and scismes breake forth, Churches are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, Preists are defiled, and other evills arise. Wherefore the cheife Preists may not imitate who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish women, who put over their children to others to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:21797:12"/> be nursed, that they may follow their pleasure, but they themselves ought to nourish them, themselves ought to render fruite to their Lord with increase, and to present the fruitfull sheaves to him with glory. For if the Lord himselfe, among other cares of his sheepe, hath touched and cleansed the leapers, why doe wee disdaine to doe the same things? Especially when as the Lord sayd to Peter,<note n="*" place="margin">

Every one who negligently feedes the Lords flocke so often committed to him, is convinced not to love the cheife Pastor, nor yet to be willing to be made his Disciple, whose examples hee neglects to imitate.</p>

                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.38.39.40.</note>Wee remember, that Iacob, who had served long for his wives, said thus to Laban: This twenty yeares have I beene with thee, thy ewes and thy shee-goates have not cast their younge, and the rammes of thy flocke have I not eaten.

If therefore hee did thus labor and watch, who fed Labans sheepe, how great paines &amp; watchings ought he to take, who feeds the sheep of God? <hi>This can no Prelate or Bishop doe, who is busied in worldly affaires or flowes in worldly

                  <hi>Epist.</hi> 37</note> Hildebert of Turen <hi>truly writes:</hi> It is impossible that hee should at any time speake with the Lord, who (even when hee is silent) talkes with all the world: Such a fable-bearer doe I, O wretch <hi>(saith hee)</hi> professe my selfe, who when as I spend the whole dayes about keeping of cattle and worldly affaires, doe not spend so much as one moment in keeping of soules. Businesses, which are worse to my spirit, meet with me, which engrosse me wholy to themselves, which steale away the secret times of prayers, which defraud Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call duties of their seasons, which as a small thing rage and vex me with stinges by day, and likewise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest me when I sleep by night; and that which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not acknowledge without teares, the creeping and theevish remembrance of causes follow me, poore wretch to the sacred Altars, where whiles I deprecate the flight thereof, I am surrounded with their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault.

Now innumme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable losses of vertues follow the captivating occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the minde, to which whiles we miserably are subject, wee doe not so much as minister with Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha: For Martha ministred, but to Christ; but which of us may say that wee doe run about and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister with Martha, who whiles wee run about, doe neither minister to Christ, nor for Christ. <hi>Hence</hi> is it (writes<note n="*" place="margin">De Statu Domus Dei. l. <hi>3.</hi> Bibl.

Whence chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty now waxing cold in many, the desire of heavenly things vanisheth quite away in us, and all the studie of virtues is turned into the appetite of transitory things. For these things men desire to be Bishops and Prelates of Churches, that they may enjoy these things, that they may flow with pleasures, that they may rather rule over the Church of God, then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit it; that they may have the family of the Church, subject to them, that they may be Lords of things, that how much the richer their Churches are, they may thereby become more famous. Since therefore ambition raignes in these men, how can they adorne the doctrine of Christ in word and example in all things? What vertue of true religion is there in them whose heartes the brightnes of divine illumination hath forsaken? <hi>Thus these, in direct opposition to this your Prelates suggestion, who pleade so much for worldly, honor, pompe, wealth, and rule, which of all other things they should most detest.</hi>

Where doe ye finde <hi>(sayd hee to the Prelates)</hi> in all Gods Law, that ye should thus sitt in judgement of any Christian man, or yet give sentence of any other man unto death as yee doe here dayly?

By Venime I meane your possessions and Lordships: For then cried an Angle in the ayre (as your owne Chronicles
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21797:15"/> mention) Woe, woe, woe, this day is venine shed into the Church of God. Before that time all the Bps of Rome were Martyrs in a maner: and since that time we read of very few: But indeed one hath put down another, one hath cursed another, one hath poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned another, one hath slaine another, &amp; done much more mischeife besides, as all Chronicles tell. And let all men consider this well, that Christ was meeke and mercifull; the Pope (and his Prelates) is proud and a tyrant: Christ was poore and forgave, the Pope is rich and a malicious manslayer, as his dayly Acts doe proove him. Rome is the very nest of Antichrist, and out of that nest cometh all the Disciples of him; of whom Archbishops, Bishops, Prelates, Preists and Monkes be the body, members, and these pild Friars the tayle. Though Preists and Deacons for preaching Gods word, ministring the Sacraments with provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for the poore be grounded on Gods Law, yet have these Sects no maner of ground thereof. Hee that followeth Peter most nighest in pure living, is next unto him in succession. But your Lordly order esteemed not greatly the behaviour of poore Peter, what ever ye prate of him.<note n="l" place="margin">

Is it not a shame above all shames and a monstrous thing, that no man should be found able to governe a worldly Kingdome save Bishops and Prelates that have forsaken the world, and are taken out of the world, and appointed to preach the Kingdome of God; Christ saith, that his Kingdome is not of this
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:21797:16"/> world, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 18. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. Vnto the young man that desired him, to bid his brother to give him part of the inheritance, hee answered; who made me a judge or a devider over you: No man that layeth his hand to the plowe and looketh back, is fit for the Kingdome of heaven, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. No man can serve two Maisters, for hee must despise the one. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. To preach Gods word, is to much for halfe a man: and to minister a temporall Kingdome, is to much for halfe a man. Either other requireth an whole man. One therefore cannot well doe both. The Bishops after they had put Christ out of his roome, they gate themselves to the Emperors and Kings, and so long ministred their busines, till they have also put them out of their roomes, and have get their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities from them, and raigne also in their steed: So that the Emperour and Kings are but vaine names, and shadowes, as Christ is, having nothing to doe in the world. Thus raigne they in steed of God and man, and have all power under them, and doe what they list. What names have they? My Lord Bishop, my Lord Archbishop, if it please your father-hood, if it please your Lordship, if it please your Grace, if it please your holines, and innummerable such like. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, how they are esteemed, and how they are crept up above all, not into worldly seates onely, but into the seate of God, the hearts of men, where they sit above God himselfe. For, both they, and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they make of their owne heades, is more feared and dread, then God and his Commandements. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrists Bishops preach not, because they have no
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21797:16"/> leisure for their lust and pleasures, and aboundance of all things, and for the combrance that they have in Kings matters; and busines of the Realme. One keepeth the privy Seale, another the great Seale, the third is Confessor, that is to say a privy traitor, and a secret Iudas, hee is President of the Kings Counsell, hee is an Ambassadour, another sort of the Kings se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Counsell.<note n="†" place="margin">Note.</note> Wo is unto the Realmes where they are of the Counsell, as profitable are the Prelacy, unto the Realmes with their Counsell, as the Wolves unto the Sheep, or the Foxes unto the Geese.<note n="*" place="margin">

Now are they indurate and tough as Pharaoh, and will not bow unto any way or order. And therefore perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute they Gods word and the Preachers thereof, and on the other side lay awayte unto all Princes and stirre up all mischeife in the world, and send them to warre, and occupie their mindes therewith, or with other voluptuousnes, lest they should have leisure to heare the word of God, &amp; to set an order in their Realms. By them is all things ministred, and by them are all Kings ruled; yea in every Kings conscience sit they ere hee be King, and perswade him what they list, and make them both to beleive what they will, and to doe what they will, neither can any King or Realme
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:21797:17"/> have rest for their busines.

               </note> Hooper, <hi>both a Bishop and Martyr of our Church, delivers his judgement of the point in these ensuing termes:</hi> For the space of 400. yeares after Christ, the Bishops applied all their witt onely
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:21797:18"/> to their owne vocation; to the glory of God, and the honor of the Realmes they dwelt in. Though they had not so much upon their heades, as our Bishops have, yet had they more within their heades as the Scripture and histories testifie. For they applied all the will, they had unto the vocation and ministry of the Church whereunto they were called. But our Bishops have so much witt, that they can rule and serve <hi>(as they say,)</hi> in both States, in the Church and also in the civill policy, when one of them is more then any man is able to satisfie, let him doe allwayes his best diligence. If hee be so necessary for the Court, that in civill causes hee cannot be spared, let him use that vocation, and spare the other. It is not possible, hee should doe both well.<note n="*" place="margin">See Bucerus De Regno Christi. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>12.</hi>
               </note> It is a great oversight in Princes thus to charge them with two burthens. The Primitive Church had no such Bishops as we. They had such Bishops as did preach many godly Sermons in lesse time then our Bishops horses be a brideling. Their house was a Schoole or treasure house of Gods Ministers. If it be so now, let every man judge. The Magistrates that suffer the abuse of these goods, be culpable of the fault. If the fourth part of the Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke remained to the Bishop, it were sufficient, the third part to Schoolemaisters, the second to poore, and Soldiers were better bestowed. If any be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with me for this my saying, hee loveth not his owne health, nor Gods Lawes, nor mans; out of which I am alwayes ready to proove the thing, I have said to be true.

And no marvail, for if the ploughmen that now be, were made Lords, they would cleane give over-ploughing, they would leave their labour, and fall to Lording outright, and the plough stand. And then both ploughes not walking, nothing should be in the Common-wealth but hunger. For ever since the Prelates were made Lordes and Nobles, their plough standeth, there is no worke done, the people starve; they hauke, they hunt, they carde, they dice, they pastime in their Prelacies with gallant Gentlemen; with their daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Minions, and with their fresh companions, so that ploughing is set aside.<note n="*" place="margin">Lording hath put downe prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21797:23"/> were as negligent in their office, as Prelates be, we should not long live for lacke of sustenance. And as it is necessary for to have this ploughing for the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentation of the body, so must we have also the other for the satisfaction of the soule; or else we cannot live long ghostly. For as the body wasteth and consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth away for lacke of bodily meate; so doth the soule<note n="*" place="margin">The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures and preaching, as many now doe, onely starve and pine, not feed mens soules.</note> pine away for want of ghostly meate. And as diligently as the husbandman plougheth for the sustentation of the body; so diligently must the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and Ministers labour for the feeding of the soule; both the ploughes must still be going as most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for man. They have great labors, and therefore they ought to have good livings, that they may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiously feed their flock; for the preaching of the word of God is called meate. Scripture calleth it meate, not strawberies, that come but once a yeare, and tarry not long, but are sone gone; but it is meate, it is no dainties. The people must have meate that must be familiar, <hi>AND CONTINVALL, and DAYLY GIVEN VNTO THEM TO FEED ON, &amp;c.</hi> And wherefore are Magistrates ordained, but that the tranquility of the Common-wealth may be confirmed, limiting both ploughes. But now for the fault of unpreaching Prelates, me thinke I could guesse what might be sayd for excusing of them. They are so troubled with Lordly livinge, they be so placed in pallaces, couched in Courts, ruffeling in their rents, dauncing in their dominions, burdened with ambassages; pampring of their paunches like a Munke that maketh his Iubely, mounching in their Maungers, and moyling in their gay Manours, and

I would heare a question, who comptrolleth the Devill at home at his parish, while hee comptrolleth the Minte? If the Apostles might not leave the office of preaching to be Deacons, shall one leave it for minting? I cannot tell you, the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that since Preistes have beene Minters, money hath beene worse then it was before: And they say, that the evilnes of money hath made all things deare. And in this behalfe I must speake to England. Heare my Country England, as Sant Paul sayd in the first Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> 6. <hi>chapter:</hi> for Paul was no sitting Bishop, but a walking and a preaching Bishop: <hi>Is there</hi> (saith hee) <hi>utterly among you no wise man to be an arbitrator in matters of Judgement?

                  </gap>y Lord Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, I meane not that I would have Prelates Lord Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, nor that Lord Bps should be Lord Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents. As touching that I sayd my minde and Conscience the last yeare. And although it is sayd, Praesent, it is not meant that they should be Lord Presidents; the office of a Presidentship is a civill office, and it cannot be, that one man shall discharge both well.</note> Lord
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:21797:24"/> President, but it must be a Prelate? Is there never a wiseman in the Realme to be a Comptroller of the Mint? I speake it to your shame, I speake it to your shame. If there be never a wise man, make a Waterbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, a Tinker, a Cobler, a Slave, a Page Comptroller of the Minte. Make ameane Gentleman, a Groome, a Yeoman, make a poore begger Lord President. Thus I speake, not that I would have it so, but to your shame. Is there never a Gentleman meet not able to be Lord President? For why are not the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and young Gentlemen of England so brought up, in the knowledge of God and in learning, that they be able to execute offices in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. The King hath a great many of Wards, and I heare there is a Court of Wards; why is there not a schoole of Wards as well as there is a Court for their lands? Why are they not set to the schooles where they may learne? Or why are they not sent to Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities, that they may be able to serve the King when they come to age? The onely cause why Noblemen be not made Lord Presidents is, because they have not beene brought up in learning. Yet there be already Noblemen enough, though not so many as I could wish, able to be Lord Presidents, and wisemen enough for the Mint. And as unmeet a thing it is for Bishops to be<note n="*" place="margin">The same reason holds our Lord Presidents, Lord Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, Lord Treasurers &amp;c.</note> Lord Presidents, or Preists to be Minters, as it was for the Corinthians to plead matters of variance before heathen judges. It is also a<note n="‡" place="margin">Note.</note> slander to the Noblemen as though they lacked wisedome, and learning to be able for such offices. A Prelate hath a charge and cure otherwise; and<note n="*" place="margin">Note well.</note> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:21797:24"/> hee cannot discharge his duty, and be a Lord President too: For a Presidentship requireth a whole man, and a Bishop cannot be two men. A Bishop hath his office; a flocke to teach, to looke unto; &amp; therfore hee cannot meddle with another office, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth an whole man. Hee should therefore give it over to whom it is meet, and labour in his owne bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines, as Paul writeth to the Thessalonians: Let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man doe his owne businesse, and follow his calling. Let the Preist preach, and the Noble men handle temporall matters. Well, I would all men would looke to their duty, as God hath called them, and then we should have a flourishing Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Weale, &amp;c. But our Blaunchers, which will be Lords and no Labourers, when they are commanded to goe and be resident upon their Cures, and preach in their benefices, they will say: What? I have set a deputy there, I have a deputy, that looketh well to my flocke, and hee which shall discharge my duty. A deputy, <hi>(quod hee)</hi> I looked for that word all this while.

               <hi>Our learned Martyr</hi> Doctor Barnes, <hi>in his</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to King Henry the 8. <hi>p.</hi> 210. 211. <hi>writes:</hi> That it cannot be prooved by Scripture, that a man of the Church should have so great temporall posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions as Bishops have. That they cannot by the Law of God have any Iurisdiction secular, and yet they challenge both powers. This is the Article that did bite you: for you cannot be content, with the office of a Bishop, but you will be also Kings. How that standeth with Gods Law, or with your oath, I have declared to our noble Prince. <hi>And our worthy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi> Master Iohn Freth, <hi>in his</hi> Answer to Master Moores Preface, <hi>p.</hi> 116. <hi>determines thus:</hi> But surely since Sylvester received such possessions, hath the canker so crept in the Church, that it hath almost left never a sound member. Before that time there was no Bishop greedy to take a Cure: For it was no honor and profit as it is now, but onely a carefull charge, which was like to cost him his life at one
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21797:26"/> time or other. And therefore no man would take it, but hee that bare such a love and zeale to God, and his flocke, that hee could be content to shed his blood for them: But after that it was made so hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and so profitable, they that were worst, both in learning and living, most labored for it, for they that were vertuous would not intangle themselves, with the vaine pride of this world, and weare their Crownes of gold, where Christ did weare one of thornes. And in conclusion it came so farre, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever would give most money for it, or best could flatter the Prince (which hee knew all good men to abhorre) had the Preheminence, and got the best Bishoricke. And then in steed of Gods word, they published their owne Commandements, and made Lawes to have all under them, and made men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive, they could not erre what ever they did or sayd. And even as in the roomes and steed of Moses, Aa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ron, Iosue, Caleb, and other such faithfull folke, came Herode, Annas, Caiphas, Pilate, and Iudas, which put Christ to death. So now insteed of Christ, Peter, Paul, Iames and Iohn, and the faithfull fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Christ, we have the Pope, Cardinals, Archbishops, Bishops, and proud Prelates, wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </note> to meddle too farre with matters of policy. If these two offices, I meane Ecclesiasticall and civill be so jumbled in both functions, there can be no quiet or well ordered Common-wealth.

Remember that Abimelech, when David in his banishment would have dined with him kept such hospitality, that hee had no bread to give him, but the Shewbread. Where was all his superfluity to keep your pretented hospitality? for that is the cause that you alleadge, you must have thousand thousands; as though you were commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to keepe hospitality, rather with a thousand then with a hundred: Remember the Apostles were so poore, that when the lame<note n="*" place="margin">

And therefore (saith hee) the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion is inevitable, that Princes may lawfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell and punish their Subjects, but Bishops may not.

               </note> Wee thinke it convenient, that all
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:21797:34"/> Bishops and Pastors shall instruct and teach the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, committed unto their spirituall charge; that Christ did by expresse words prohibit, that none of his Apostles, nor any of their Successors, should under the pretence of authority, given unto them by Christ, take upon them the authority of the sword, that is to say, the authority of Kings, or of any civill power in this world, yea or any authority to make Lawes, or ordinances in causes, apertaining unto civill powers. If any Bishop, of what estate or dignity soever hee be, be hee Bishop of Rome, or of any other City, Province, or Diocesse, doe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to take upon him authority or Iurisdiction, in causes or matters, which appertaine unto Kings, and the civill powers and their Courts, and will maintaine or thinke, that hee may so doe by the authority of Christ and his Gospell, although the Kings and Princes would not permit and suffer him so to doe. No doubt that Bishop is not worthy to be called a Bishop, but rather a tyrant, and a usurper of other mens rights, contrary to the Lawes of God, and is worthy to be reputed none otherwise, then hee that goeth about to subvert the Kingdome of Christ. For the Kingdome of Christ in his Church is spirituall, and not a carnall Kingdome of the world: that is to say, the very Kingdome that Christ by himselfe, or by his Apostles and Disciples sought here in this world, was to bring all nations from the carnall Kingdome of the Prince of darknes unto the light of his spirituall Kingdome, and so himselfe raigne in the hearts of the people by grace, faith, hope, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:21797:34"/> charity. And therefore sith Christ did never seeke nor exercise any worldly Kingdome, or dominion in this world, but rather refusing and fleeing the same, did leave the said worldly governance of Kingdomes, Realmes and Nations, to be governed by Princes and Potentates (in like maner as hee did finde them) and commaunded also his Apostles and Disciples to doe the semblance; whatsoever Preist or Bishop will arrogate, or presume upon him any such authority, and will pretend the authority of the Gospell for his defence therein, hee doth nothing else; (but in a maner as you would say) crowneth Christ againe with a crowne of thornes, and traduceth and bringeth him forth againe with his mantle of purple upon his backe, to be mocked and scorned of the world, as the Iewes did to their owne damnation. <hi>Thus all our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and Clergy (and after them</hi> King Henry the 8. in his necessary Erudition for any Christian man, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized and approoved by the Satute of 32.

               </note> that when Hubert, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of Canterbury, was made Lord Chauncellour, cheife Iustice of England, and high Governour of all the Kings Dominions immediately under him, that hee was much blamed, and that not unworthily, and no lesse envied for taking these offices upon him: in so much that a Noble man said unto him in scorne, at what time hee was made Chauncellor, I have heard of many Chauncellours made Bishops, but of an Archbishop, that would vouchsafe to stoop to the Chauncellorship, till now I never heard of any, (for most Bishops that were Treasurers and Chauncel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, were first such Lay-officers, and Lay-men to, and then made Bishops for a reward of their service or better maintenance; not first Bishops, and then made Treasorers, Chauncellers, and such like tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall officers.) Whereupon within two yeares after his advauncement to these high places, the better to excuse his ambition, hee made a dissembling and counterfeit shew of being desirous to have his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall offices, in so much as hee dealt effectually with the King by letters, to give them leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe them,<note n="†" place="margin">Yet our great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates thinke not so.</note> saying, That the charge of his Church was worke enough for one man, whereunto onely hee would gladly dedicate himselfe. This hee did assuring himselfe in his owne conceit, that the King knowing
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:21797:35"/> no man about him so likely, to manage those affaires as himselfe, and not being able to want him, would intreat him to retaine them still: But the King thinking his motion reasonable, and not willing longer to deny it, the Archbishop thus taken tardy in his owne snare, as though his minde and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation were suddenly altered, signified unto the King in letters, that notwithstanding his great desire of betaking himselfe onely to spirituall matters, and the manyfold infirmities of his age, hee would be content to afford his labour and diligence in his other offices yet a while longer, if therein hee might doe his Majesty any profitable service, acquainting him with all, that in these two yeares, since his perfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hee had gathered for his use 1100000. markes which hee was ready to pay into his coffers, augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting (it is like) the summe; and adding thereto out of his his owne purse, that so hee might in cleanly sort buy againe those honorable and gainefull offices, which his subtile dissimulation had almost lost him. But the King not long after, upon a petition of the Lords in Parliament, thrust him out of these offices; to which when he was againe restored; the Pope upon complaint by the Monkes of Canterbury of his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medling in civill affaires, presently enjoyned him without further delay, to resigne all his temporall offices; which hee (how loath soever) was faine to doe; the Pope assuring him, that hee would neither suffer him, nor any other Bishop or Clergy man to intermeddle in temporall affaires, commaunding all Prelates of the Church, upon their Canonicall
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:21797:36"/> obedience, not to take upon them any temporall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, because being intangled in secular businesses, they could not possible sufficiently discharge their spirituall functions; for as the wise man saith:

               </note> reprehended the Cleargy for this very thing, that being advaunced to the degree of divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then which nothing in humane life ought to be deemed more holy, they should be hindred there from with secular businesses, as with servile workes, and being withdrawen from divine things, should give themselves to pecuniary and exchequer affaires which are most estranged from the dignity of their life, by which some (as appeares by the example of that Dean of Paules) have made shipwrack both of Conscience and soule to. Wilhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Nubrigensis speaking of Hugh, Bishop of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resme, for intermeddling with the procuration of temporall affaires, hath these words: That office (to wit, of Lord Chauncellour or cheife justice) was committed by the King to the Bishop of Duresme, who did not so much as refuse, but chearfully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it; who verily contenting himselfe with his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per office, had much more decently beene a Minister of Gods Law, then of mans; since no man can serve both, as hee ought. And that saying of our Lord to the Apostles, <hi>yee can not serve God and Mammon,</hi> did principally respect the Apostles Successors. For if a Bishop that hee may please both the heavenly and earthly King, at once will devide himselfe to both of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices:
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:21797:39"/> Verily the heavenly King, who wills that men should serve him with all the heart, with all the foule, and with all the strenght, doth neither approove, nor love, nor accept his divine ministry. What then will hee doe, if a Bishop doth not give peradventure not so much as halfe of himselfe to execute the things which are of God, and become a Bishop; but committs his cures to unworthy and remisse execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, that hee may wholy serve an earthly Court or Palace? For no halfe man can sufficiently admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister the offices of an earthly Prince. By which sentences and examples wee verily are admonished, that assiduous care and study of Cleargy men, in worldly and civill affaires, which makes them proove slow and unfit to divine things, is by all meanes to be reprooved, and that the complaint of those is very unjust, who tax them for not intermeddling with temporall affaires, and study to call them back from divine things, to which they ought with all their might to apply themselves. <hi>Thus this Archbishop</hi>

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:21797:53"/> to the Rules of the Imperiall Law, as the civile Magistrate did proceed in other causes, neither did the Emperours, in giving this Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction unto them, give away their owne supreme and absolute power, to correct &amp; punish these Judges, as well as others <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>f they perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not their severall duties. This then is most certaine that the primitive Jurisdiction in all these causes, was in the Civill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, and so in right it remaineth at this day, and though i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> be derived from him, it remaineth in him, as in a Fountaine; For every Christian Monarch (as well as the Godly Kings of Juda) is custos utriusque Tabulae, and consequently hath power to punish, not onely Treason, Murder, Theft, in all maner of Force and fraud, but incest, adultery, usury, perjury, Simony, sorcery, idolatry, blasphemy, neither are these causes in respect of their owne quality and nature, to be distinguished one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the names of spirituall or temporall. For why is adultery a spirituall cause, rather then murther, when they are both offences against the second Table, or Idolatry, rather then perjury, being both offences likewise against the first Table? And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if wee consider the natures of these causes, it will seeme some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what absurd; that they are distinguished by the name of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and temporall, for to speake properly, that which is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to spirituall, should be tearmed carnall: And that which is opposed to temporall, should be called eternall. And therefore if things were called by their proper names, adultery, should not be called a spirituall offence, but a Carnall. But shall I expresse plainly and briefly, why these causes were first denominated, some spirituall or Ecclesiasticall, and others tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and Civill? Truly, they were so called, not from the nature of the causes, as I said before, but from the quality of the persons, whom the Prince had made Judges in these causes. The Clergy did study spirituall things, and did professe to live se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum spiritum, and were called spirituall men, and therefore they called the causes, wherein Princes had given them Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, spirituall causes, after their owne name and quality. But because the Lay Magistrates were sasd to intend the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:21797:53"/> things of this world, which are temporall and transitory, the Clergy called them secular or temporall men, and the causes wherein they were Judges temporall causes:</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note>
               <hi>This distinction began first in the Court of Rome, were the Clergy having by this Jurisdiction gotten great wealth, their wealth begot pride, their pride begot ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude towards Princes, who first gave them their Jurisdiction, and then, according to the nature of all ungratefull persons, they went about to extinguish the memory of the benefit: for whereas their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction was first derived from Caesar, in the execution whereof they were Caesars Judges, so as both their Courts, and causes ought still to have borne Caesars Image and Superscription, as belonging unto Caesar; They blotted Caesars name out of the style of their Courts, and called them Courts Christian, as if the Courts holden by other Magistrates had beene in Comparison but Courts of Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nickes, and the causes w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ithin their nature were meerely Civile, they called spirituall and Ecclesiasticall. So as if the Emperor should challenge his Courts, and causes againe, and say,</hi> Reddite Caelari, quae sunt Caesaris, <hi>they would all cry out on the contrary part, and say,</hi> date Deo, quae sunt Dei, <hi>our Courts beare the name and Title of Christ, the Superscription of Caesar is quite worne out, and not to be found upon them. And this point of their Policy is worth the observing, that when they found their Jurisdiction in Matrimoniall causes, to be the most sweet, and gainefull of all other (for of Matrimony they made matter of Mony indeed) to the end that Caesar might never resume so rich a perquisit of their spirituall Iurisdiction, they reduced Matrimony into the Number of the seaven Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. After which time it had beene sacriledge, if the civile Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate had intermedled with the least matter that had relation to Matrimony, or any depentancy thereupon. So then yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that all causes whereof Ecclesiasticall or Spirituall persons have cognisans, or Iurisdiction by the grants or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Princes, are called Ecclesiasticall or Spirituall causes. And as all their Courts are called spirituall Courtes, so all causes determinable in these Courts, are called spirituall causes.</hi>

Which Statutes being all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, and the Kings Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction fully restored in as large, (if not more ample) maner as ever Henry the 8. or King Edward the 6. injoyed it, by the Statutes of 1. <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1. and other Statutes since.

               </note> as the Iudges Commissions are at every Assises and Eyre, that so they may know, they keepe their Visitations, onely by the Kings authority. And so much the rather, because Popes and Bishops have usually challenged the right and power of Visiting as due unto themselves alone, though in truth a principall branch of the Kings owne Royall Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction, <hi>united to the Crowne, by the expresse words</hi> of the Statutes of 26. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 1. 37. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 17. 1. <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:21797:62"/> owne names, as their owne inherent right; whereas no Iudge or Iustice whatsoever hath beene so presumptuous or disloyall, as to keepe Assises or Sessions in his owne name or right, but in the Kings alone: And if our Prelates and their Officers have no such Commission from the King to visit, keeping visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in their owne names and rights, not his; the Ministers and Churchwardens are bound by their Oath of Allegiance and Supremacy, to resist their visitations; not suffering them to proceed therein, and to refuse their visitation Oathes, which they have no Commission authorizing them to administer: else they are directly perjured and disloyall to his Majesty, in<note n="k" place="margin">1. <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1 28. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 10.</note>
               <hi>not defending to the uttermost of their power, all Ecclesiasticall Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, priviledges, and preheminences, granted, united, and apertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to his Imperiall Crowne,</hi> as they have promised by their Oath, whereof this of visiting the Ecclesiasticall State and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons is the cheifest. Now to proove, that Archbishops, and Bishops have no power at all, to visit their Diocesse, but by speciall Letters Patents from the King, and in his name and right alone: I should only demaund of them this short question; whether this right of Visitation they claime and contend for, belongs to them onely <hi>Jure Divino</hi> by a divine right, or a <hi>Jure Humano,</hi> by some humane Title? If they say <hi>Jure Divino;</hi> that certainely is untrue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Because Archbishops &amp; Bishops themselves superiour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o, and distinct from Ministers, are not of divine, but meere hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane right and institution, long after the Apostles times, as I have elsewhere prooved: themselves therefore being not of divine right, they can challenge no power of Visitation by a divine Title.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The instituting of Provinces, Diocesse, and setting of one Archbishop or Bishops over many Cities. Churches or Parishes as a generall Visitor and Superintendent over them, is a<note n="*" place="margin">This all the Archbishop.

               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Wee finde not in all the Scripture that Christ ever gave any such power of Visitation to his Ministers or Bishops, or to the Apostles themselves, neither finde wee one president in all the Bible of any Episcopall Visitation (much lesse of any Visitation, Oathes or Articles) kept either by Christ himselfe, or any of his Disciples, much lesse by Bishops. How then can that belong to Archbishops or Bishops, <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> which hath neither precept nor President to warrant it in all the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture? True it is, that the<note n="*" place="margin">Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on Act. <hi>15.36.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>Rhemists</hi> would ground this right of Visitation which the Bishops and Archbishops claime as their peculiar inheritance to them and their Successors for ever, on <hi>Acts</hi> 15.36. <hi>And some dayes after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us goe againe and VISIT our brethren in every City, where wee have preached the word of the Lord, and set how they doe.</hi>

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:21797:63"/> of the word <hi>visit</hi> in our owne common speech, when one freind or neighbour goes to see another, which wee call a Visitation (whence wee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay, <hi>I will goe and visit, or I have beene visiting</hi> such a freind, neighbour, prisoner, or sicke person;) by the very <hi>title and forme of the Visitation of the sicke in the Booke of Common-prayer;</hi> and by the very last words of the verse; <hi>Let us goe visit our brethren, and see how they doe:</hi> Which words, <hi>See how they doe,</hi> plainely resolve this, to be a Visitation onely of love and charity, such as was of <hi>Moses Acts.</hi> 7.23. <hi>or that of Mary who went up into the Hill-countrey to visit her Cosen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, Luke</hi> 1.35. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore no Archepiscopall or Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Visitation by way of Iurisdiction. So that the argument hence can be but thus: <hi>Paul and Barnabas went to visit the brethren, to whom they had preached, to see how they did;</hi> or a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister may goe to visit his Christian Freindes or neighbours at their houses in love. Ergo Archbishops and Bishops visitations are <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> and none but they have any divine right to visit. A learned <hi>Nonsequitur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Wee read of no Visitation Oathes or Articles in all this Visitation, set out and delivered to Churchwardens and Sidemen, to present on upon Oath in Paul or Barnabas names; of no Chancellers, Registers, Appariters, Citators, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, presentments, suspensions, excommunications, fees of Court, shewing of Orders, or licenses to preach or keepe a Schoole, &amp;c. as are in all our Metropoliticall and Episcopall visitations: this Visitation therefore can be no president for our Prelates, which hath no affinity with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> These Apostles here went to those particular places onely, <hi>where they had formerly preached the Gospell,</hi> and to no other, visiting none but those. If our Archbishops, and Bishops should doe so, their Diocesse would not be so great, nor their visitations so long, as now they are, yea some of them would ha no Diocesse at all to visit, unlesse it were <hi>White-hall,</hi> or <hi>Paul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s-Crosse,</hi> or perchance their owne <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drals,</hi> but no one Parish of their Diocesse, in which they never
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:21797:64"/> preached: and some of them should by this account, visit more places out of their Diocesse then within them. If this Text therefore prooves any thing, it is this, that Archbishops and Bishops, must preach the Gospell through out every place and Parish in their Diocesse and Provinces before they goe to visit them; and then never an Archbishop or Bishop of them all, could ever keepe a Visitation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Paul and Barnabas here intended to visit joyntly, not severally, as our Bishops doe; they visit in p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rson, not by Proxy or deputy, as our Lord Bishops use; they preached in all places where they visit, which few Bishops doe: they went to see and <hi>visit their brethren in diverse Parishes;</hi> they did not send to divers Parishes, to come to meet and visit them out of their owne Parishes as our Bishops now doe, who in truth are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther visited by their Diocesse, then their Diocesse by them. This Text therefore proues not their Visitations to be <hi>Jure Divino.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Paul and Barnabas were no Bishops, but A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles; and this their Visitation was no other then any Minister, Christian, yea Woeman (and Woemen now are the greatest gadders and Visitors,) may and use as well as they. It there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prooves not, that the right and power of visiting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs onely to Archbishops and Bishops <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> but the contrary, that all Ministers at least (if not other Christians) may visit their brethren and those places, where they have preached, as well as Archbishops or Bishops, if not rather and better, unlesse they preached more. There being then there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no divine right, that Prelates can pretend for their visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, as these reasons proove, and the forecited Statutes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly resolve; Our Bishops must then claime it (if they have any right to it) either from the King (who<note n="‡" place="margin">31. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c</hi> 9. 1. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6 <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note>

Therefore they must sticke onely to the Kings Title, and doe all in his name, right and authority, and then farewell their divine right and inherent Episcopall power, which they so much boast of, and contend for even before his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties presence.</p>
            <p n="6">6.

               <hi>King Henry the eight, An.</hi> 1541. <hi>being the</hi> 34. <hi>yeare of his Reigne, erected the Bishopricke of Oxford by his Letters Patents, making the Church of the Abby of Oseney the Cathedrall Church and Episcopall See of that Bishopricke, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titling it,</hi> Ecclesia Beatae Mariae De Oseney; <hi>creating Rober<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:21797:68"/>
               <hi>the King thought meet to translate the See from Oseney Abbey, unto Cardinall Colledge, (since called Christ Church) then newly erected by Cardinall Woolsey, whereupon the first Patent ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the Bishopricke at Oseney Abby was surrendred, and by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Patent the Bishops See, translated to Christ Church Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; wherein the King placed a Bishop, a Deane,</hi> 8. <hi>Preben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries, a Quier, and other Officers, besides a hundred Students to be maintained in the same, enstiling the Cathedrall; <hi>Ecelesia Christi Cathedralis Oxon. ex fundatione Regis Henrici Octavi;</hi>
               </hi> upon which Surrender this Patent of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense was granted by the King to the Bishop of Oxford.</p>
            <p>From which I observe. <hi>First,</hi> that all the Episcopall Jurisdiction, which our Prelates doe or can challenge, is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved onely and immediately from the King, by his Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, and resignable onely into his hands. Therefore not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by Bishops immediately from God, nor due unto them <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> for then it could not be surrendred backe againe into the hands of men. To make this more perspicious, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that every Archbishop and Bishop here in England, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived two things of different natures from two severall sorts of persons.</p>
            <p>The <hi>First,</hi> is his Bishopricke and Episcopall Jurisdiction thereto annexed, this hee receives meerly from the King by Letters Patents, as the precedent and following Patents mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, and the <hi>Statutes of</hi> 1. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 2. 37. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8. <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1. resolve.</p>
            <p>The <hi>second</hi> is his Episcopall Ordination and Consecration, this hee receives onely from the Archbishops or Bishops, who ordaine and consecrate him onely by vertue of and upon the Kings Letters Patents directed to them; By the first, hee hath power to admit, institute, and inducte Ministers to livings, to keepe Consistories, Visitations; inflict Ecclesiasticall Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures; hold plea of Ecclesiasticall causes; proove Wills and Testaments, grant Letters of Administration, consecrate

               <hi>By the second hee hath power to preach Gods word, administer the Sacraments of baptisme and the Lords Supper, read divine Service in the Church, and</hi> (with the consent and assistance of others of his Clergy) <hi>to ordaine Ministers and Deacons,</hi> which every Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, as the<note n="c" place="margin">When this prayer is done the Bishop, with the Preists pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, shall lay their hands se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally upon the head of every one that recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved orders.</note>

True it is, men that so abuse it, as to make themselves unworthy of the Ministry, may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of it by the King, and such Commissioners, as hee shall authorize; but they cannot resigne, transferre the same to any, as they may doe the first.</p>
            <pb n="131" facs="tcp:21797:69"/>
            <p>The first, they may execute by themselves, or their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, onely; if the King authorizes them, so to doe, as hee doth in this Patent: The second they must discharge and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute in person,<note n="‡" place="margin">See Bishop Latimers Serm. of the Plough, Bp.

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is apparant by this Patent, that no Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop, Bishop, or other Ecclesiasticall person, can, or ought to execute, exercise, or practise any Ecclesiasticall Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, power, or authority, either by himselfe or his Officers, but by vertue of some grant and speciall Patent made to him in that behalfe, by the King: the sole cause why Bishops in those dayes tooke such Patents and Licenses as these. Why then should they exercise and execute any Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction in their owne names without such Licenses and Patents, now? Is it, because Bishops have more Ecclesiasticall Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, now <hi>Jure divino,</hi> then their Predecessors had then? Or because, Bishops in these dayes usurpe much more upon the King and Crowne, and shewlesse duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes to their Soveraingne, then they did in that age? Or is it, because our present Soveraigne hath lesse Ecclesiasticall Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction then King Henry the eight? The first, it cannot be, for Gods Law was then the same it is now.</p>
            <p>The last it cannot be, since the Statutes of 1. <hi>Eli. c.</hi> 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>By a Writ of privy Seale, and the Date aforesaid, by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this Patent (and sundry others of this forme) it is apparant, that the Bishops power to ordaine, and institute Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters to Churches, to keepe Consistories, and Eccesiasticall Courts, to hold plea of Ecclesiasticall causes, to inflict Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall Censures, to keepe Visitations, and to inquire of such offences as deserve their Censure without Oath, (for this, nor any other Bishops Patent gives them no power to administer an Oath in such causes,) to proove wills and grant Letters of administration, deprive or suspend Ministers, and the like, is derived to them onely from the King, and not <hi>Jure divino,</hi> by any divine right: that Bishops ought to have these Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions granted to them by the Kings Letters Patents under the great Seale, and that they ought to keep their Courts, Visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and make out all their proces, onely in the Kings name, and right, as his Officers and Visitors onely, under paine of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpation, and a <hi>Praemunire;</hi> which they neither doe, nor are willing to doe, (as appeares by the Archbishops late contest the 21. of Iuly 1636. before the King himselfe at Hampton Court, where the sole question was, whether the Archbishop by his owne Episcopall authority, without any speciall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from his Majesty, and in his name and right alone, as his
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:21797:71"/> Visitor, should visit the University, which none of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors since the beginning of Reformation had done before him? which cause miscaried for want of true reformation of his Majesties right,<note n="‡" place="margin">See Fox Acts and Monuments p. <hi>1405. 1294.</hi>
               </note> but proceed onely by their usurped power and authority. <hi>Bishop Jewell in his Sermon on Psalm.</hi> 69. <hi>p.</hi> 190. recordes, <hi>that Pompeius a Gentl. of great wealth and notable courage did build a Theatre, such a one as before had not beene, which would containe</hi> 25000. <hi>men, contrary to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation and Order taken; but doubting lest the next Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates should destroy it,</hi>

               </note>
               <hi>hee caused a place of religion to be set upon it, and called it the Temple of Venus. Whereby hee provided, that if any would overthrow it, because it was a Theatre, they might yet spare it for the Temples sake; For to pull downe a Temple was sacriledge. Even so there have beene Proclamations and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi> (saith hee) <hi>that no man should be called the cheife, or head of all Churches, or usurpe such authority over others; but when the Pope built up his Supremacy against the meaning of such Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, hee pretended religion for his doing, hee said hee was</hi> de Iure Divino, <hi>that no man should presume or attempt against it, and that so his power might continue for ever.</hi> Iust so our Prelates, imitating the Pope in this his Stratageme, and well knowing, that by the Doctrine of the Scriptures, Fathers, and the forecited Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, they have no greater authority or Iurisdiction then Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and that all their Episcopall Iurisdiction &amp; authority above ordinary Ministers, is derived only from the King and humane institution, and so subject to be revoked or restrained at the Princes pleasure; doe therefore labour, to build their pretended Episcopall Iurisdiction and authority upon divine institution, against the meaning of the Scriptures, Fathers, and foresaid Statutes, and publikely teach and define, that it is <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> that so no man should presume or attempt against it, though they most intollerably abuse it, and that this their extravagant usurped power might continue for ever, to oppresse Gods Church and People. Since therefore our Prelates are such notorious usurpers, both upon the Kings Ecclesiasticall Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative

                  <hi>Sir Edward Cooke hath long since stiled them in his Reports;</hi> yea these <hi>Ex officio</hi> Oathes and Articles, are contrary to <hi>Archbishop Whitguifts owne confession and protestation before King James, and his Councell in the Conference at Hampton Court, p.</hi> 90.

               </p>
               <p>But now the course is cleane contrary to what it was then, for if any man refuse to take the Oath, even before hee see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Articles touch him in point of liberty, or scandall, (as all now doe, since they have made imprisonment, a censure of course, in all causes there sentensed,) or else refuse to answer, fully to their Articles which touch his reputation, liberty, and lively-hood, or the losse of his living and Ministry, hee shall be forthwith layd up in a filthy Dungeon, or nasty prison, as many of late and heretofore have beene; and their Articles taken as confessed.

The Officers in Christs Kingdome may have no temporall Dominion or Jurisdiction, nor execute any temporall authority or Law of violence, nor may have any like maner among them: Christs Kingdome is altogether spirituall, and the bearing of rule in it, is cleane contrary to the bearing of rule tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally.

But with violence will God have no men cōpelled unto his Law.

Master Andrew Melvin, in his excellent Anatomie of the High-Commission,</hi> printed 1620. prooves at large: <hi>That Bishops and Clergymen, neither as they are such, nor yet as High-Commissioners, or temporall Officers, can or ought to commit or imprison any man, because these being branches, onely of temporall Magistrates Jurisdiction, are expresly prohibited all Bishops and Ministers by our Saviours,</hi> Vos autem non sic: <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.25.26. <hi>both directly and indirectly, the inhibition being a universall negative, reaching to the persons as well as to the functions of Ministers and Prelates, whom Christ would not have
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:21797:103"/> to intermeddle with any temporall office, or Jurisdiction, belonging to the temporall Magistrate, no more then hee would have tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Magistrates to administer the Apostles, or Ministers office.</hi> And it will be a poore plea for Bishops, and other Clergymen at last, when Christ shall arraigne them, for breach of this oft reiterated commaund, to reply; that they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned, fined, and pursevanted his servants, and their fellow-Ministers, as they were High-Commissioners, Lords of the Councell, or Iustices of peace, (neither of which Christ ever made or allowed them to be,) not as they were Bishops, or Ministers: and if Christ condemne them for it, as such; I am afraid, they will hardly be saved, as they are Bishops or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters. Since therefore all these Fathers and writers, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite others, condemne your fining, and imprisoning of men, as directly contrary to Gods word, and Christs owne inhibition: your walking in your Predecessors unlawfull ever condemned footsteps, is but a<note n="p" place="margin">

                  <hi>within time of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,</hi> and the present commission is yet scarse 4. yeares old,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:21797:103"/> and the High-Commissioners fining and imprisoning, hath yet ever since it hath beene used with one consent, beene declai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med against as illegall, and so oft adjudged.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Finally,</hi> The Commissioners and Prelates now exceed their Predecessors in all the forementioned extravagancies, growing every day more violent, exorbitant, and oppressive; therefore this fond excuse, will no wayes palliate or extenuate their illegall Actions, Censures, proceedings, which are exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable, abominable, both to God or man, diametrally oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to all these wholesome statutes, intollerable oppressions, and greivances to his Majesties loyall Subjects, and so meerely erronious and voyd in Law, by these forecited statutes reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution?</p>
               <p n="3">3. To the <hi>Third,</hi> That the Starchamber examines men upon Oath against themselves, and fines, and imprisons men: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the High-Commissioners may doe it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. I answer, <hi>First,</hi> That the Argument is a meere <hi>Non sequitur:</hi> the one Court being Civill, the other Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall, both in respect of causes and proceedings, the one kept onely by an arbitrary Commission; the other absolute by <hi>Act</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>3.</hi> H. <hi>7.</hi> c. <hi>1</hi> See Cromp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons Iurisd. of Courts, f <hi>29.</hi> to <hi>42.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>of Parliament.</hi> And if this be a good argument, I know no reason, but every Bishop may inferre as well: The Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber can fine, imprison, examine men upon Oath, in cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall causes: Therefore wee may doe it in our Consistories and Visitations, which Conclusion is both false and absurd. And the High-Commissioners may as well argue, that the Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber adjudgeth men to<note n="*" place="margin">See Cromp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Ibidem.</note>
                  <hi>the Pillary, to loose their eares, and the like; and may pun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sh all forjuries, perjuries, routs, riots, conspiracies, trespasses in parkes, subornation of perjury, and the like:</hi> Therefore the High-Commissioners may doe it. I am sure, they dare not argue thus; The Kings Bench can hold plea of Trespasse, Debt, Felonies, Murthers, Treasons, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge men to death for the same; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Ecclesiasticall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:21797:104"/> may doe it: This were but a frenticke consequent: Why not then the other? Shall the Lords of the Starchamber argue thus? The High-Commissioners may hold plea of all Ecclesiasticall offences, and punish men by excommunication, degradation, sequestration, and other Ecclesiasticall Censures; <hi>Ergo,</hi> we may much more doe it? If the Prelates will not grant this consequence, as I presume they dare not: I must by the same, or farre better reason deny to grant the other.</p>
               <p>But to give a more punctuall answer. <hi>The statutes of</hi> 37. <hi>E.</hi> 3. c. 18. 38. <hi>E.</hi> 3. c. 9. 16. <hi>R.</hi> 2. c. 2. 3. <hi>H.</hi> 7. c. 1. 5. <hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 9. 14. <hi>if not the Common Law it selfe authorize the Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber to fine, imprison, and inflict other corporall punishments, in such cases, as are expressed in these Acts; as Master Cromp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton in his Jurisdiction of Courts, Tit. Court De Starchamber, f.</hi> 29. <hi>to</hi> 42. <hi>at large demonstrates.</hi> But no statute, much lesse the Common Law, gives the High-Commissioners any such power.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Starchamber being a temporall Court, for the punishment of the highest temporall offences, which are not capitall, may inflict temporall censures and punishments, (as fines and imprisonment) on delinquents, yet they cannot impose Ecclesiasticall. But the Commissioners (being<note n="‡" place="margin">

                  <hi>onely Ecclesiasticall Judges, in Ecclesiasticall causes, punishable by no Common or statute Law, but by Ecclesiasticall Censures onely,</hi>) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not inflict temporall punishments, as fines and imprisonment, no more then the Starchamber can Ecclesiasticall Censures, for temporall offences; much lesse then, both temporall and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall punishment for one and the selfe same offence, which no Court of Iustice else can doe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is true, that the Starchamber useth to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine men in criminall causes upon Oath, and men are there bound, to put in their answers upon Oath, to the informations, and bills, exhibited against them; but then wee must consider,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:21797:104"/>1. <hi>First,</hi> That no other Court of Iustice else can or doth use it, but the Starchamber onely; The Kings bench cannot examine felons, traytors, trespassers, or any persons indited, or informed against before them, nor yet compell them to answer upon Oath. The Chauncery, Exchequer-Chamber, Court of Wards, and Court of requests, though they injoine men in Civill causes onely, concerning the rights and properties of goods, and such like, to answer to English Bills upon Oath; <hi>yet they cannot doe it against; as hath</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">
                     <hi>Dyer.</hi> 288.</note>
                  <hi>beene adjudged:</hi> and though they use sometimes in cases of Contempts, and of them alone, to examine men upon Oath to Articles criminally objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, yet this is extrajudiciall, not warranted by Law; and the parties examined may lawfully refuse such Oath, and put the Court or party, whom it concernes, to proove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt by witnesses. If then neither, the Kings bench, Chauncery, or any other Court of Iustice, but the Starchamber onely, can examine men criminally upon Oath; I may better conclude, that the High-Commissioners cannot doe it, because no other Courts else, but the Starchamber can or doe ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly use it; Then our Prelates inferre, that they in the High-Commission may doe it, because the Starchamber ordinarily doth it, but no Courts besides.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Starchamber Iudges have authority (at leastwise some good couler of authority, thus to proceed, by the <hi>statutes of</hi> 3. <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>and</hi> 21. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 20. which give them <hi>expresse power, to call delinquents before them by writ, or privy Seale, and them and other by their discretion, by whom the truth may be knowne; to examine,</hi> (to wit, upon Oath as common practise hath interpreted it, though it be not expressed) <hi>where the Judges in their discretions shall thinke meet:</hi> notwithstanding some learned Iudicious men have conceaved, that this clause authorizeth not the Starchamber to examine delinquents cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minally upon Oath, to accuse themselves, it being contrary to the <hi>Common statute, Canon Law, Scripture, and the proceedings,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:21797:105"/> both of the Jewes and Romans,</hi> as the Premises evidence, but onely without Oath, and none but witnesses, onely upon Oath. But let this be interpreted as it may be, yet the Statute of 1, <hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 1. gives the High-Commissioners no power at all, to administer any Oath, <hi>no not of Supremacy prescribed by it,</hi> much lesse to examine any man at their discretions upon Oath, for any Ecclesiasticall offence, there being no such clause, as this in that Act; And by the <hi>Common and statute Law</hi>

                  <hi>else the party may demurre and refuse to answer them,</hi>) hee needs give no other answer to them, what hee hath given before to the Bill by advise.</p>
               <p>The Oathes and proceedings therefore of the Starcham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, being so farre different from those of the High-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners, and farre more just and legall, then their<note n="*" place="margin">See And.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>First,</hi> That all Bishops and Ministers by Christs insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution are of equall authority and Iurisdiction, and that one of them ought not to Lord it, or domineere over the other, as all Bishops now every where doe, both over their fellow-brethren and the people: and that Bishops and Ministers by Gods Law are of equall degree, dignity, power, and Iurisdiction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That Bishops and Ministers ought to be pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes of humility, meeknes, charity, compassion, brotherly kindnes, and forgivenes unto all others: and yet who so swolne with Antichristian pride, ambition, envy, hatred, malice, slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; so revengefull, implacable mercilesse as they, as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon proverbe, (as proud, as malicious as a Prelate,) witnesseth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi>

               <p>Hence <hi>Origen,</hi> in his 31. <hi>Hom. upon Matthew,</hi> writes thus: <hi>Verily that Bishop sinneth whomsoever hee be, who doth not minister like a servant to his fellow-servants, but like a Lord, yea, very often domineering by violence even like a bitter Lord, being made like the Egyptians, who afflicted the life of the children of Israel with force: therefore they ought to be mindefull of the words of Christ:</hi> The Princes of the Gentiles domineere over them, &amp;c. But among you it shall not be so. Hence <hi>Prosper Aquitanicus,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines thus of the Prelates in his time, <hi>De Vita Contemplativa, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 21. <hi>Wee are made potent onely for this end, that wee may purchase, and usurpe to our selves a tyrannicall Domination over those who are under our charge, not that we might defend the afflicted against the violence of great men, who rage against them like wild beasts. Wee delight onely in things present, seeke onely whilest wee are in this life, our owne profits and honours, hastening not that wee may be better but richer, not that we may be holier, but that wee may be more honourable and greater then others: neither doe wee minde the floock of the Lord, which is committed to us, to be fed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, but wee carnally thinke of our owne pleasures, Dominion, and other worldly allurements. We will needs be called pastors, and yet wee strive not to become such, wee shunne the labor of our office, and yet desire the dignity thereof.</hi> Hence also<note n="t" place="margin">Ad Clerum Sermo in Concilio Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensi.</note>
                  <hi>Sant Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> complaines of the Prelates in his age, in this sort: <hi>They are not Pastors, but betrayers; they are called Shepheards, when as in truth they are but theives.

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:21797:137"/> thou oughtest by all meanes to consider, to what purpose; not to domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neere, as I conceave; for even the Prophet, when hee was in like maner advaunced heard,</hi>

These things speake thou to thy selfe, and teach thou thy selfe, who teachest others; reckon thy selfe but as some one of the Prophets. Is not this sufficient to thee? yea too much: But by the grace of God, thou art what thou art. What? Be thou, that which a Prophet is: art thou any thing more then a Prophet? If thou art wise thou wilt be content with the measure that God hath meated to thee, for that which is more, is from the evill one: learne from the Prophets example how to beare rule, not so much to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, as diligently to performe what Christ requires; learne that thou needest a weeding hooke, not a scepter, that thou mayest doe the worke of a Prophet: And verily hee ascended not as one about to raigne, but to extirpate: Thinkest thou that thou mayest not finde some worke to be done in the feild of thy Lord? yea very much: the Prophets could not plainly cleanse it all, they have left some things to their sonnes the Apostles to doe; yea thy very parents have left some thing to thee, neither mayest thou thy selfe suffice to doe every thing; verily thou shalt leave some thing to thy Successor, and hee to others, and they to others unto the end.

If thou art content with their tenure, thou shalt rather inherit care and labor, then glory and riches, doth thy chaire flatter thee? It is no Watch Tower: Finally, thou overseest from thence, sounding to thy selfe, in the name of a Bishop, not a Dominion, but an office: Why shouldest thou not be placed in an eminent place, whence thou mayest overlooke all things, who art constitute a watchman over all things? for truly this prospect begets readines, not idlenes. How canst thou take pleasure to glory, where it is not lawfull for thee to be idle? nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any roome for idlenes, where a sedulous solicitude of all Churches oppresseth. For what else hath the holy Apostle demised to thee? That which I have, said hee, that give I unto thee: What is that? One thing I know, it is not gold nor silver, seeing himselfe saith,</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts.</hi> 4.</note> Silver nor gold have I none, <hi>if thou chance to have any, use it not according to the lust, but as the time requires; be thou such a one using them, as if thou usest them not. These things verily so farre as appertaines to the good of the minde, are neither good nor ill, yet their use is good, their abuse evill, their desire or care worse, their lucre more dishonest; But be it so, that thou mayest challenge it unto thee, by any other meanes whatsoever, yet truly by any A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall right thou canst not so doe, for how could hee give unto thee that which hee hath not himselfe? That which hee had, that hath hee given, the care over the Churches, as I have said. But hath hee given thee any Lordship? Hearke: what hee saith, not bearing rule, saith hee, as Lords in the Cleargy, but behaving your selves as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to the flock: And because thou shalt not thinke it to be spoken onely in humility, and not also in verity, marke the voyce of the Lord himselfe in the Gospell:</hi>

If thou wilt be a Lord, thou shalt loose thine Apostle-ship, or if thou wilt be an Apostle, thou shalt loose thine Lordship. Goe thou then and presume to usurpe to thy selfe, either an Apostle-ship being a Lord, or a Lordship being an Apostle. Verily thou art prohibited and must depart from one of them; if thou wouldest have both, thou shalt loose both, or else
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:21797:138"/> thinkest thy selfe to be in the number of those, of whom God doth so greatly complaine, saying:</hi>

                  <hi>If I durst be bould to speake, these things are rather the food of Devils, then of Sheep: What? Did Peter doe thus? Did Paul thus play the vice? Seest thou not, how all their Ecclesiasticall zeale is fervent, onely to defend their dignity? all is attributed to dignity, nothing or very litle to holines. If cause re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring, thou shalt attempt to doe somewhat more submisly, or to shew thy selfe more sociable, they say God forbid; it becomes thee not; it agrees not to the time, it is not suitable to thy Majesty, consider the person which thou bearest. Of the pleasure of God there is no mention at all, no delay for the losse of salvation. Wee may call no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wholsome, but that which is sublime, and that onely just, which savours of glory: Thus all humility is esteemed a reproach among the Prelates. So that thou mayest more easily finde, one who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to be, then to appeare humble: The feare of the Lord they repute
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:21797:138"/> simplicity, that I say not folly. A circumspect man and a freind of his owne Conscience, they calumniate for an hypocrite. Here, here I spare thee not, that God may spare thee: shew thy selfe to this people a Pastor verily, or deny thy selfe to be one. Thou wilt not deny it, least hee, whose seate thou possessest deny thee to be his Heire; Hee is Peter, who was never knowne to have gone abroad at any time, either adorned with Jewels, or silkes, or covered with gold, or carried on a white Palfery, or guarded with souldiers, or invironed with ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, making a noyse round about him, yet notwithstanding hee beleived that this sacred mandate,</hi>

In these thou hast succeeded not Peter, but</hi> Constantine. <hi>I counsaile, that they are to be tollerated in respect of the time, not to be affected as of due. I rather incite thee to these things, of which I know thee to be a debter. And although thou goest clad in purple, although in gold, yet thou mayest not abhorre either Pastorall labor or care, being the Heire of a Sheepheard; thou mayest not be ashamed to preach the Ghospell; for verily if thou doe it willingly, thou shalt have glory among the Apostles. To preach the Ghospell is to feede. Doe the worke of an Euangelist, and thou hast fullfilled the worke of a Pastor. Thou sayest, you admonish me to feede Dragons, and Scorpions, not sheepe. For this cause rather set upon them, but yet with the word, not with the sword; Why doest thou attempt againe to usurpe the sword which thou hast beene once commaunded to put up into the scabheard? which notwithstanding hee who shall deny to be thine, seemes to me not sufficiently to have considered the word of the Lord, saying thus:</hi> Put up thy sword into its sheath: <hi>therefore it also is thine, perchance at thy commaund, although not to be unsheathed with thy hand. Both swords therefore are the Churches, as well the spirituall as materiall; but that verily is to be exercised for the Church, but the other by the Church; that by the hand of the Preist; this, of the Souldier, but yet at the beck of the Preist, and the commaund of the Emperour.</hi> And in his 23. <hi>Sermon upon the Canticles</hi> hee concludes: <hi>Let the Prelates heare this, who will be alwayes a terror to those committed to their
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:21797:139"/> charge, seldome a benefit. Be instructed, ye who judge the earth: learne, that ye ought to be the mothers of your Subjects, not their Lords; Study rather to be beloved then feared: and if at any time there be use of severity, let it be fatherly, not tyrannicall: shew your selves mothers by fostering, fathers by reprehending, waxe meeke, lay aside your feircenes, suspend your stripes, produce your duggs: Let your brest wax fat with milke, not swell with pride: why doe you make your yoake heavy upon such, whose burthens ye ought rather to sustaine? Why doth a litle one bitten by the Serpent, flie from the Conscience of the Preist, to whom hee ought rather to have recourse, as to the bosome of his mother. If ye be spirituall, instruct such a one with the spirit of meekenes, considering every one himselfe least hee also be tempted.</hi> Thus this devout Father: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing our Saviours owne inhibition, and these Fathers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and declamations, our Lordly Prelates, both of present and<note n="i" place="margin">Socrates Schol.

               <p>I shall begin to close up this Breviate with the words of <hi>Nicholas de Clemangiis,</hi> in his excellent Booke, <hi>De corrupto Ecclesiae statu, chap.</hi> 14. <hi>to</hi> 20. where hee thus paints out in live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly coulours. the maners, practises, oppressions, designes, and lives of the Prelates and their Officers in his age, and ours too: <hi>Those who at this day are promoted to the dignity of a Bishop, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the maner of their professions, with great earnestnes on
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:21797:144"/> every side, greedily gape after gaine, not verily of soules, but of purses rather, the gaine whereof they seeke out every where: they burne after gaine, they repute gaine godlines, they doe nothing at all but that which they beleive, way sufferagate to collect many upon any occasion; for which they wrangle, contend, chide, goe to Law, taking the losse of ten thousand soules more patiently, then of</hi> 10. <hi>or</hi> 12. <hi>But I justly reprehend my selfe who said, more patiently, when as they take the losse of soules with no motion or perturbation of mind, of which there is not onely with them no care, but not so much as any thought; yet they undergoe even the smallest losses of any part of their estate, almost with a furious and distracted mind. Moreover, if peradventure any Bishop or Pastor shall arise, who will not walke after this maner, or who contemnes money or damnes covetousnes, who finally will not every way, whether just or unjust, extort money from his Subjects, or study to gaine soules by wholsome exhortation or preaching, and meditates more in the Lawes of the Lord, then in the Lawes of men, presently all their teeth are set on edge to bite him: they</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Now they cry out on him as a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan besides.</note>
                  <hi>will cry him up to be altogether an unfit man, not worthy of the Preisthood; because hee being ignorant of Humane Lawes, is not fit to defend his rights: knoweth not how to governe, punish, and restraine his Subjects by Canonicall Censures, and hath learned no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, but to give himselfe even to a Laysie idlenes, or to preaching which they openly affirme, to be the office of Mendicants, enjoyning no temporall care, or administration, which may possesse their minds with a more profitable occupation. Therefore now the studies of (he sacred Scriptures, with their professors are turned into laughter, and a mocking stock with all men; and which is most prodigious, especially towards Prelates, who preferre their owne traditions farre before Gods Commaundements. That egregious and most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent office of preaching, attributed onely to Pastors or Bishops in times past, and principally due to them, hath now</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">And is it not so with our Prelates now, some of them having not preached one Sermon in <hi>12.</hi> yeares space and most of them but one Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or two at most in a yeare.</note>
                  <hi>waxed so vile with them, that they thinke nothing more unworthy or dishonourable to their dignity then it. But loe, whilest I consider the proper sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of the Court of Rome, I am fallen upon those vices, which are common with them, even to other Prelates: Which yet I will
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:21797:144"/> handle more particularly in a succinct relation, because I have a fit place. First it ought not to seeme strange or a wonder unto any, if our Prelates principally study, to scrape together moneyes on every side, if being thinne, leane, and empty, they study to fat themselves with the juice, wooll, and milke of their sheepe, of whom it appeares, they were made Pastours at so deare a rate. For flies (as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe is,) pined with leannes bite more sharply. Likewise all living Creatures consumed with famine, are carried more greedily to the prey. For although before the undertaking of their Episcopall cure, they were very wealthy; (neither are indigent men wont to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted thereunto,) yet by the Ministry conferred on them, they ought at least to empty their purses for the most part. Wherefore justly and not without cause, they make it their cheifest labour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenish them againe. And by the Example of a wise husbandman, that they may gather the seed, they have sowed with increase and great returne, and againe recover and diligently enlarge their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished Substance, like most vigilant tradesmen, they expose all their wares to sale to all who need them. If any Clerke among them for theft, for Homicide, for rape, or sacriledge, or any other enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mious crime be cast into prison and adjudged to the dungeon there, to eate bread and water, hee shall so long be liable to punishment, and suffer for his offences as a guilty person, untill hee shall pay the money demaunded of him, according to the measure of his revenues or goods. But when hee shall doe this hee is set at large, and suffered to goe away like an innocent, every Error, all wickednesses, although they are capitall, are released and blotted out by money. For what shall I speake of the exercise of this Jurisdiction, which is so</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Thus is it now.</note>
                  <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently and tyrannically governed, that at this day men rather choose to undergoe the Judgements of the most cruell tyrants, then of the Church. It cannot be expressed how great evils those wicked Inquisitors of crimes which be called promotors or Apparators, doe unto the people.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Thus our Bishops Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritors serve his Majesties Subjects at this day.</note>
                  <hi>They oft times call simple and poore husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, living, an harmlesse life in their cottages, and ignorant of the Cities fraud, into their Courts, for a thing of naught, they diligently feine causes and crimes against them, vexe, terrifie, threaten them;
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:21797:145"/> and so by these meanes compell them to compound and agree with them. Which if they refuse to doe, they dayly serve and infest them out of measure with frequent Citations; and if once hindred by any occasion, they shall faile to appeare, presently they are struck with the Sentence of Excommunication as Rebels and contumacious. But if they shall continue to appeare at the day as oft as they shall be called; they will hinder their audience at the Judges tribunals, they will lay hold of delayes and subte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>fugies, of imparlances, and interlocutions, which are very easily obtained from Ecclesiasticall Courts; that so being tyred out with long delay, and great losse of their time, they may be compelled to redeeme their future vexation, and expenses, with a Summe of money, least they should incurre a heape of infinite expences, for a small or no offence, or for a litle debt. Now I pray, what a thing is this, that in most Diocesse Rectors of parishes doe everywhere keepe Concubines at a certaine rate and hire, which they agree for with their Prelates? That all excesses and vices of Subjects, and all offices, even in Court of Judicature, are publikely sold by them? But to those of which wee have spoken, and shall speake, these things are good. But how is this to be endured, that no man comes to a Clerkeship,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">It is not so now with our Prelates.</note>
                  <hi>or to a sacred order, or to any Eccesiasticall degree, but by reward? that none bestow sacramentall grace, or imposition of hands, unlesse hee shall give a certaine price before hand? that they make all Confessions, Absolutions, Dispensations veniall? that if any benefices are devolued to their disposition, they bestow them for gaine, or give them to their bastards, or to stage players? Now if any man peradventure shall object that Euangelicall saying to them: Freely ye have received, freely give: they want not what they may presently answere; that they did not freely receive, therefore they are not bound by the Text, freely to give. Finally, they say, that those Bishops onely are bound by this sentence, who have obtained their Pastorall office, without any disbursement at all. Therefore no man (but hee who strayes farre from the truth,) may expect, that grace should be thus sold by equity, for how is it grace, if it be not freely given? unlesse wee will deeme it false, that that pestiferous Sorcerer was reprehended by Peter, with a direfull
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:21797:145"/> malediction, who thought that the gift of God might be purchased with money. Now from this fountaine that copious multitude of vile and most unworthy Preists hath issued. For that they might receive greater gaine by conferring Orders, they admit all as many as shall come with none or litle difference, to those titles which they shall aske, (unlesse perchance there be some so oppressed with poverty, that they are not able to pay for orders:) there is no examination of their forepast life, no question of their maners. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Letters and learning what bootes it to speake, when as wee see that almost all Preistes can scarce reade, and that way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and by sillables, without any understanding of the things or words. What fruite therefore, what audience shall they obtaine by their prayers, either to themselves or others, to whom that, which they pray is barbarous? How shall they reconcile God by their prayers unto others, whom they have made offended with themselves with their ignorance, their filthines of life, and by their ministry? If any man at this day be idle; if any abhorring labour, if any be willing to riot in idlenes, hee flies to the Ministry; which having obtained hee forthwith associates himselfe to the other Preists, who are followers of pleasures;</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">And doe not many of the Clergy now a dayes doe this.</note>
                  <hi>Who living more after Epicures then after Christ, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently frequenting Alehouses consume all their time in drinking, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling, pransing, feasting, playing at tables and at ball. And being surfeted and drunken, they fight, they warre, they make a tumult, they curse the name of God and of his Saints, with their most polluted lips. And thus composed, at last, they come from the very em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracements of their harlots to the divine Altar. But I returne to our Bishops, who being educated in all lubricity from their youth, they introduce such witnesses, that I may soo speake, Ministers, into the Church, whose acts are memorable, this ought not to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted by me; that many of those who have obtained the top of a Pastorall dignity, and have enjoyed the same for many yeares,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Some of our Prelates too are guilty of this, that they never saw some of their Diocesse, yet they have fleeced them by their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty Visitors.</note>

<pb n="284" facs="tcp:21797:146"/> their rich spoyles by strangers, and hirelings. I have said strangers, because even they themselves are hirelings, who seeke not the custody, safety or profit of their flocke, but onely the retribution of a temporall reward. Therefore they themselves are hirelings, having onely the name of a Bishop, because the thing signified by the name is farre from them. For the name of a Bishop signifieth a Watchman or Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: Behold (saith the Prophet) I have made thee a Watchman to the house of Israell. But these verily watch not at all over the flock, they oversee nothing, they looke to nothing: they take the care of their owne body, they feed themselves and not their sheepe, not greatly weig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what accident may happen to the sheepe, whether they die con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed, either with sicknes or famine, so as themselves may gaine any thing by their death.</hi>

                  <hi>But peradventure some man will say, that they may justly be pardoned: if they seldome goe to their Diocesse, or more slowly visit their litle flockes; because being sent for to be Princes Counsels, they handle the great affaires of the Kingdome, &amp; governe, defend, support the Common-wealth, which rests upon their shoulders, and would otherwise most greivously fall to ruine; which seemes to be more Laud-worthy, then to consult their owne private affaires. First I will by no meanes grant them this, that they are willingly called out by Princes of their owne accord to be Consellers of state, but they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it with great suite, costs and intercessions of freinds;</hi>

                  <hi>not verily out of any zeale or care of the Republike, of which they have no love or charity at all; but for the stipends and large gifts which accure unto them from thence, that living upon other mens costs they may treasure up the revenues of their owne Churches. Finally what profit bring they to the languishing yea almost dying, and now well nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buried Common-weale? Would to God they brought no destruction thereunto!

God I trust shall shortly disclose their jugling, and bring their falshood too light, and lay a medicine to them, to make their scab breake out.</note>
                  <hi>all the burthens of taxes, and tributes, with which the people
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:21797:146"/> are at this day charged, by their subtility and suggestions, and that being invented, they heape them one upon another, and cause them to last for so long a time? whence even long agoe there hath beene a Custome in this Kingdome (France hee meanes, which is now true of England likewise,) that some Bishops are set over such exactions, and determine the causes and complaints concerning them. Whether doe they herein profit the Republike, that being called to the Counsell and commaunded to speake their opinions, they perswade those things which they know, will rather please the Prince, then profit the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth? that oft time being led with bribes, oft times with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, oft times with hatred, oft times also with feare they sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest to the eares of their Lords, not just, not true, not sincere things, but perverse and hurtfull things, covered over with fallacie? Furthermore, doe they helpe the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth in this thing, that they oft privily inculcate, that greater allowance is to be contributed to those Rectors who administer it, and more then the common allowance?

                  <hi>Finally, which of them is a Defender of the poore, a comforter of the afflicted, a releiver of the oppressed, who a patron for the fatherlesse, who a protector to the poore widdowe against the false accuser? Yea verily who is more estranged from the compassionating and commiserating of any distressed poore people then they, and truly too, doth the Prophet I say speake under the Image of the Princes of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, of whom these, although they are their Successors in wickednesses, in respect of time, yet peradventure they may be rightly termed their predecessors in vilenesse; Thy Princes are treacherous and companions of theives, every one loveth guiftes, and followeth after rewards, they judge not the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, neither doth the cause of the widdowe come unto them. But it is a wonderfull thing what that meanes, that now almost every Bishop receives yearely almost sixe, seaven, or ten thousand Crownes from the Church, of which hee is

For although that be more, which the Church giveth them, than what the Prince, yet that office joyned to the greater, makes the summe the bigger, and too good things are better then one. Further the fruits that are given them by the King, they know they shall not receive, unlesse they waite at the Kings elbow; but those which accure unto them from their Churches they know shall be given them, though they be farre off, and free from service. What and if they impute no doubt their promotion made at the instance of the King, to the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selve, and not to God, nor to the Church? Therefore like gratefull men, no wayes forgetfull of him by whome they have obtained grace they deservedly according to the vicissitude of obedience more willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly referre their service and obedience unto them.</hi>

Episcopus is as much to say, as an Overseer, or Superintendent, whose office was in the primitive Church purely to instruct the multitude in the wayes of God, and to see that they were not beastly ignorant in the Holy Scripture, as the most part of them are now a dayes.

For one man to be both a King and a Bishop is a beast of many heads, a two headed Monster: that verily, which wee read in ancient Coynes and Epigrams, Decius and Nero, and such Tyrants and worshippers of false Gods to have beene. It is the abominable scorne and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of nature, the anger of God, and our sloath and sluggishnes, that the Prince of Princes, should serve the Servant of Servants. If the Pope be the servant of the servants of God, why doth hee not serve? why doth hee not love? why doth hee not minister? why doth hee not feed? why doth hee not teach? why doth hee not preach? If hee will be that hee desires to be, why doth hee not follow the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps of Christ, of Peter, and Paul, in prisons and various dangers? why doth hee lye, play the turne coate, deceive, raigne, domineere, out of his greedines of power, he confounds high &amp; low things together for money, all things are veniall, hee sets God and Hell to sale, why doth hee so litle esteeme the life of Christ, who refused to be an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trator betweene the brethren, desiring him to devide the inheritance

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>From all these concurring Romish authorities, both forraigne and domesticke, of ancient moderne and present times, (for I have purposely omitted all Protestant writers, who speake more home and
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:21797:156"/> fully to the point, because our Bishops litle regard them,) these foure conclusions necessarily arise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>First,</hi> That temporall and spirituall Iurisdiction, are so distinct and severall in their owne natures, that they ought not to be confounded in any one Prelate, or spirituall person, no not in the Pope himselfe: therefore not to be conjoyned in our Bishops, or executed both together by the selfesame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in one, and the selfsame Court and cause; as they are now of late by our Bishops and others, in our Ecclesiasticall High-Commissions; who there smite with both swords at once, and inflict both temporall, and Ecclesiasticall Censures on one and the selfesame persons, at the selfesame time, for one and the same offence; as their dayly practise witnesseth, contrary to all Courts and Presidents whatsoever in former ages, either at home or abroad.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That neither the Pope himselfe, (of whom most of these authorities are particularly meant,) nor any other Archbishop, Bishop, Prelate, or Ecclesiasticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whatsoever, hath, or ought to have, or exercise by the Law of God, any temporall power or Iurisdiction, directly, or indirectly, <hi>being in expresse termes prohibited them, by Christ</hi>

               <hi>himselfe;</hi> but, to content themselves onely with the spirituall sword, and Censures, and that authority which Christ hath given them. Therefore they neither may nor ought to beare any temporall office, magistracy, rule, or judicature in the Common-wealth, nor yet to inflict any ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill temporall Censures or punishments, (as fines, imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, confiscation of goods, losse of freeholds, banishment, suspention from mens lawfull trades and vocations &amp;c.) on any of his Majesties Subjects, especially for Ecclesiasticall, (and oft times for no) offences, (as they dayly doe in the High-Commission, contrary to Law and the practise of all former
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:21797:157"/> ages,) but onely to rest, satisfied with Ecclesiasticall Censures, and to proceed no further.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That no Ecclesiasticall persons, by vertue of any Ecclesiasticall power or Iurisdiction, could fine, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prison, or inflict any other temporall punishments on any man for Ecclesiasticall offences, but onely punish him with<note n="†" place="margin">No an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councels did ever im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prison Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes or Scismatickes or fine them for these faults, but onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them.</note> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Censures, before the making of the <hi>Statute of</hi>

Therefore <hi>the Statute, uniting onely the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Jurisdiction to the Crowne in that state as then it found it, abolishing the Statute of</hi> 2. <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 15. <hi>and all other Acts against Hereticks, and giving the Queene her Heires and Successors, a power onely to delegate her Ecclesiasticall</hi> (not her temporall) Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction <hi>to the High-Commission,</hi> neither gives nor intended to give the High-Commissioners, any power at all to fine or imprison any Subjects, or to inflict any corporall or temporall Censures on them for Ecclesiasticall offences, as it is now their dayly practise.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That it is as unseemely, as unlawfull for Bishops and Ecclesiasticall persons to beare temporall offices, manage civill affaires, or exercise temporall Iurisdiction, Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, or Dominion over others, either in secular or Church affaires, as it is for Emperors, Kings or temporall Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, to exercise the function of Bishops or Ministers, to read Divine Service, preach, administer the Sacraments of Baptisme and the Lords Supper, conferre Orders, and the like; or to excommunicate men in their temporall Courts, for secular crimes. And that as Kings, and temporall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, continuing such, cannot doe not ordinarily exercise the Bishops, or Ministers spirituall function, or inflict Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall Censures, no not by a speciall deputation, license, or authority from Bishops and Ministers, so they on the other side, by the same reason cannot, may not, by themselves alone,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:21797:157"/> or by vertue of any speciall Patent, or Commission from Princes and temporall Magistrates, exercise any Civill or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Iurisdiction, or inflict any temporall Censures on men for Civill, much lesse for spirituall offences; because such Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction and Censures are unsuitable to their callings, <hi>and directly prohibited them by</hi>

               <hi>Christ, in universall negative termes;</hi> whose inhibition will proove meerely nugatory, if Kings by speciall Patents or Commissions, may authorize them, to execute that power, that authority, which hee so expresly forbids them to intermeddle with, and so dispence with them against the very letter of Gods word, which no King can doe. Each of these conclusions is naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from, and fully warranted by all and every of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mized authorities; which I wish our ambitious Prelates (with our temporall Magistrates, Lords, and Iudges,) would now at last seriously consider. Wee read in all our ancient and late Acts of Parliament, <hi>that Lord spirituall and temporall,</hi> are contra distinct termes, and Titles designing two different rankes and conditions of men, occupied about different objects, and imployments.

            <p>AS thou canst heale no disease, except thou beginne at the roote, even so canst thou preach against no mischiefe, except thou beginne at the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops. Whether Iudas were a Priest or no, I care not what hee was; but of this I am sure, that hee is now not onely Priest, but also a Bishop, Cardinall, and Pope. Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops that preach not, or that preach ought save Gods word, are none of Christs, nor of his annoynting, but servants of the beast, whose marke they beare, whose word they preach, whose Law they maintaine, cleane against Gods Law. Bishops, they onely can minister the temporall sword, their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice the preaching of Gods word, layed a part, which they will neither doe, nor suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any man to doe; but sley with the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall sword, (which they have gotten out of the hand of all Princes,) them that

For it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to preach Christ, except thou preach against Antichrist, that is to say, them which with their false doctrine and violence of sword enforce to quench the true doctrine of Christ. Our Prelates ought to be our servants, as the Apostles were, to teach us Christs doctrine, and not Lords over us to oppresse us with their owne.</p>

Fiftly, that our Martyrs condemned Ex Officio and Visitation Oathes, for men to accuse themselves or others, as unlawfull, and would not take them; as appeares by M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>.

Sixtly, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Rhemists</hi> themselves in their Annotations on Acts. 23. v. 12. resolve thus. <hi>If thou be put to an Oath to accuse Catholickes for serving God as they ought to doe, or to</hi>

Rev. 12.10. Math. 18.16.25. H. 8. c. 14. 1 Elis. c. 1. which require proof of all things by two witnesses at least.</p>
